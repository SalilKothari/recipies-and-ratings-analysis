Analyzing Recipies and Ratings Dataset

# Introduction

Our dataset consists of information on recipes, as well as associated reviews and ratings for each of those recipes. Some important data regarding the recipes dataset to keep note of throughout the report are the nutrition values (calories, total fat, carbs, sugar, etc.), the average ratings, and the cooking time. 

We wanted to center our analysis around variables like the average rating, calories, and the cooking time, so we asked the question: what is the relationship between average rating and calories? 

Although our analysis is centered around this question, we still chose to explore all variables of interest, including cooking time and the other macronutrients. 

Lastly, we will give an overview of the dataset for convenience throughout the report:

- There are 234,429 rows
- Column Names of Interest
